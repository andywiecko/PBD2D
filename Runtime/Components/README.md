### TriMesh

The simplest two-dimensional structure made of triangles.
One can convert sprites to simulated objects using built-in triangulator and scriptable objects.
**TODO**: tutorial how to.

Supported constraints:

- Edge length constraint (see [system](#edge-length-constraint-system)),
- Triangle area constraint (see [system](#triangle-area-constraint-system)),
- Shape matching constraint (see [system](#shape-matching-constraint-system))

### Ground

As the name suggests, the component represent the plane surface.
**TODO:**...

Implemented collisions:

- with [TriMesh](#trimesh).
